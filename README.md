# SNAKE GAME

We all have played snake games of some sort with either Nokia(one of man's most impressive feats) or modern devices. but few of us ever wanted to build it and fewer have achived such goal. 

# WELCOME TO SNAKE GAME "your own"

## 🛠️ FEATURES
-- **Turtle** i made sure we could all tweak the program using one of the most simple python modulo's out there. you could find it's documentation [HERE](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html)

-- **pygame** uses pygame for sound effects


## SETUP
- **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pygame

i don't think i need to explain how to play this game much.  use the direction keys up, down, left & right, paste the code below if you wanna use w, s, a and d under screen.listen() and above game_is_on = True on main.py.

- **keys**
   ```bash
   screen.onkey(snake.up, "w")
   screen.onkey(snake.down,"s")
   screen.onkey(snake.left,"a")
   screen.onkey(snake.right,"d")
i could've added that to the program but i want you to edit the program to your liking so it truly becomes your own. make the background color a diffirent color by changing screen.bgcolor(). once you get hold of the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html), the world(this game) truly becomes your oyster.
